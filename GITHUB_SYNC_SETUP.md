## How to Set Up Cross-Device Blog Synchronization

Your portfolio now has GitHub API integration for cross-device blog synchronization! Here's how to set it up:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click your profile picture â†’ Settings
3. Scroll down to "Developer settings" (left sidebar)
4. Click "Personal access tokens" â†’ "Tokens (classic)"
5. Click "Generate new token" â†’ "Generate new token (classic)"
6. Give it a name like "Portfolio Blog Sync"
7. Select scopes: âœ… **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
8. Click "Generate token"
9. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Configure Your Portfolio

1. Open your portfolio website
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Run this command with your token:
   ```javascript
   githubSync.setToken('YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE');
   ```
4. Test the sync by creating a blog post

### Step 3: How It Works

- **Creating Posts**: Automatically syncs to GitHub
- **Deleting Posts**: Automatically syncs to GitHub  
- **Viewing Posts**: Always loads latest from GitHub
- **Fallback**: Uses localStorage if GitHub is unavailable

### Step 4: Cross-Device Testing

1. Create a post on your laptop
2. Check on your phone - it should appear automatically
3. Delete a post on your phone
4. Check on your laptop - it should be gone

### Security Notes

- The token gives full repo access - keep it secure
- Don't share your token publicly
- You can revoke the token anytime in GitHub settings

### Troubleshooting

- If sync fails, posts are saved locally as backup
- Check console for error messages
- Make sure your GitHub username/repo name are correct in `github-sync.js`

Your blog data will now sync across all devices! ðŸš€
